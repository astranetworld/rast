## Introduction

**Rust Blockchain Project** is a high-performance, decentralized public blockchain written in Rust. It leverages Rust's memory safety and performance capabilities to deliver a secure and scalable blockchain platform.

## Features

- **Decentralized Consensus**: Implements a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, ensuring a secure and energy-efficient network.
- **Smart Contracts**: Supports smart contracts using WebAssembly (Wasm), allowing developers to write contracts in multiple languages.
- **High Throughput**: Optimized for high transactions per second (TPS), suitable for large-scale applications.
- **Interoperability**: Compatible with existing blockchain ecosystems, enabling cross-chain communication.
- **Security**: Built with Rust to ensure memory safety and prevent common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (v1.50 or later)
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (optional, for front-end tools)
- [Wasm-Pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/) (for smart contracts)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/astranetworld/rast.git
cd rast
```

Build the project:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Run a local node:

```bash
cargo run --release -- --dev
```

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
cargo test
```

### Documentation

Generate the documentation locally:

```bash
cargo doc --open
```

## Usage

### Setting Up a Node

To set up a full node, follow these steps:

1. Install Rust and Cargo (if not already installed).
2. Build the project using the steps outlined above.
3. Run the node using the provided command.

### Interacting with the Blockchain

Use the command-line interface (CLI) or integrate with the blockchain via the JSON-RPC API.

### Deploying Smart Contracts

1. Write your smart contract in Rust or any language that compiles to Wasm.
2. Compile the contract using `wasm-pack`.
3. Deploy the compiled Wasm file to the blockchain using the provided CLI tools.
